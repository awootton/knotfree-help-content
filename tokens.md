This confusing bit of jargon and alien user interface serves two basic functions.

Fortunately it's really only something you need to do once at the beginning.

### A secret key.

The first thing is that you need to do is set a 'passphrase' which is really just like a password but is supposed to be longer. In fact it needs to be at least 20 characters to keep people from breaking it. If you don't care then use something short. There's no enforcement.

Just click on the 'TYPE A PASSPHRASE' button:
![set-pass-button](/images/images/set-pass-button.png)
and type one in.
![set-pass-input](/images/set-pass-input.png)

Click OK!
Then it will look like this: 
![set-pass-done](/images/set-pass-done.png)

You don't need to do anything with the owners public key right now and you probably won't need to change it again **unless** you switch computers or browsers and have to set it up again. This is why it's important that you saved it. You wouldn't want to lose your bitcoin secret key either! 

### A 'token' for permission to use the system.

There are situations where you may need the long chain of random letters that a token is. For now it's easy.
Just click on the big fat GET NEW ACCESS TOKEN button and you're done. You will get one for free. No fuss no muss.
