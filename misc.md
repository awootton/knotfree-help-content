## Configuration

All the settings that you have entered are saved securely in the browser you are using.
You can get a copy of those setting by pressing the ```COPY ALL CONFIG TO CLIPBOARD``` button.

One interesting thing to do is to set up everything how you like it on a laptop and then copy the config, send it to yourself (or something) and then ```SET CONFIGURATION``` on your phone and then you don't have to do the setup again on your phone where it's harder to type and copy paste. 

You may also clear all the configuration back to the default state with the ```RESET CONFIGURATION``` button. 

## Cluster statistics. 

There is not just one computer servicing the messages and this webpage. There's a cluster. The ```GET CLUSTER STATS``` button will retreive the status of those computers. Mostly this is just for me, your humble author, to debug problems.

## Build date.
This is when the version you are using was released. 
## ‚ü≥
Shift click reload in the browser, to get the latest version.

## PUSH ME

Just a gratuitous egotistical easter egg. It's safe to ignore. 

## Password ideas

Many passwords are either not very safe by virtue of not being long enough or hard to type and remember.
Using a series of words solves this problem. The ```GET PASSWORD IDEAS``` button will make a random password for you. If you use all 14 words the number of combinations is about 10^42 or about 140 bits and is seriously uncrackable. Just 4 words is a trillion combinations. Use as many has you like.
